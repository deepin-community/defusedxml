Description: XML bomb protection for Python stdlib modules (for Python 3)
 The results of an attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic.
 With just a few hundred bytes of XML data an attacker can occupy several
 gigabytes of memory within seconds. An attacker can also keep
 CPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request.
 .
 This library allows for XML to be parsed in a manner that avoids these
 pitfalls.
 .
 This package contains the module for the Python 3 interpreter.
